## Repo Guidelines
1. Use **kebab-case** when naming new repositories. Make sure to use an appropriate prefix (ike).
2. In the settings, disable 'Issues' and 'Wiki' (replaced by Linear app and Notion respectively).
3. Prefer monorepos over polyrepos.
4. Don't store binaries in git, use S3 instead.
5. Include Linear issue number in commit messages using the Conventional Commit format.
